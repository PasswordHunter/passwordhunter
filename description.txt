Password Hunter is a comprehensive security tool designed to extract sensitive 
information from popular web browsers and devices.The project is aimed at cyber
security students and professionals who are interested in web browser and device security.

The primary objective of this tool is to provide a quick and easy way for security analysts
to extract sensitive information from target systems. The tool is capable of extracting 
passwords, browsing history, cookies, web data, and device information from Chrome, Firefox,
and Microsoft Edge browsers, as well as stored Wi-Fi passwords and MAC addresses, IP addresses,
models, and operating system details. from the Windows operating system. By using this tool,
analysts can better understand the security posture of a system and identify potential 
vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

One of the key features of this tool is its modular design, which allows for easy extension 
and maintenance. The program consists of five Python files, each responsible for extracting
information from a different source. This approach enables the tool to support multiple 
browsers and devices and provides a framework for adding support for additional sources of 
information in the future.

The tool also has a simple and user-friendly command-line interface, making it accessible to 
both novice and experienced users. The interface provides options for selecting the target 
browser and device and the type of information to be extracted.

The tool's extraction capabilities are based on well-established techniques used by security
analysts and penetration testers. The program is written in Python, a widely-used programming
language in the cyber security field, and leverages Python libraries such as sqlite3 and 
subprocess to interact with the target system and extract the desired information.

Despite its many benefits, there are some limitations to this tool. Firstly, it only works 
on Windows systems, limiting its use to other operating systems. Additionally, it currently
only supports three web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave), although this could 
be expanded in the future. Finally, the tool requires administrator privileges to extract
some types of information, such as Wi-Fi passwords.
